Let's say you have two Github accounts - `john_wick` for personal use, and `john_doe` for work. We can use ssh keys and define host aliases in ssh config file; each alias for an account.

## Generate ssh key pairs for github accounts

Run the command substituting your github email address to generate the ssh keys for both Github accounts.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "johnWick@hightable.org"
```

Add your ssh keys to respective Github accounts by going to:

```bash
Settings -> SSH and GPG keys
```

### Docs

- [Generate ssh key pairs for accounts](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key/)
- [Add ssh key to GitHub accounts](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)

## Edit or create ssh config file

Create a file named `config` without any extesion in your `<root>/.ssh/` directory with contents below:

```bash
# Default github account: john_wick
Host github.com
   HostName github.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_wick
   IdentitiesOnly yes

# Other github account: john_doe
Host High-Table
   HostName github.com
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_doe
   IdentitiesOnly yes
```

_NOTE:_ `High-Table` in the config file is coming from github overview page of your organization.

```bash
Example: https://github.com/High-Table
```

## Add ssh private keys to your agent

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_wick
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_doe
```

### Docs

- [Add ssh private keys to your agent](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent/)

## Test your ssh connections

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
ssh -T git@High-Table
```

You'll see a prompt asking for a confirmation as below:

```bash
The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.252.1)' cant be established.
RSA key fingerprint is xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

If everything is alright you'll see a success response like down below:

```bash
Hi John Wick! You have successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## Last piece of the puzzle

Close any remote repository

```bash
git clone git@high-table:paraballem/chapter-3.git <path-to-directory>
cd <path-to-directory>
git config user.email "johnDoe@hightable.org"
git config user.name  "John Doe"
```

If for any reason you're having any issues with cloning you can try to create an empty directory and then run the following commands.

```bash
git remote add origin git@high-table:paraballem/chapter-3.git
git pull origin master
```

I've faced this issue with an organization project where I was unable to clone but the second approached worked fine.

And, if you are still facing any issues with even the second approach then you can try the same approach after overriding the default ssh key for repository.

```bash
git config --local core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_doe"
git remote add origin git@high-table:paraballem/chapter-3.git
git pull origin master
```

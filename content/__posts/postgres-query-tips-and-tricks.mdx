## Filter records based on datetime range

We can treat a timestamp column just like an integer value, and if we've stored date or time as in a certain string format like `YYYY-MM-DD` then we can parse it into a timestamp integer value using the query below.

```sql
TO_DATE(DATE_OF_BIRTH, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
```

It'll return a regular timestamp value using the `DATE_OF_BIRTH` that can be treated as an integer.

The below query will filter the users based on their date of birth and will return only users under 18.

```sql
SELECT
  USER_ID,
  DATE_OF_BIRTH
FROM PUBLIC.USER
WHERE (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '18 years')::date < TO_DATE(T2.DATE_OF_BIRTH, 'YYYY-MM-DD');
```

## Derive a column from existing column

It could be achieved using `CASE` clause. It is a conditional expression in PostgreSQL that allows you to return different results based on different conditions.

**Syntax:**

```sql
CASE
   WHEN condition1 THEN result1
   WHEN condition2 THEN result2
   WHEN condition3 THEN result3
   ELSE default_result
END
```

**Example:** The below query returns an additional derived column `Under 18` containing either `true` or `false` depending on date of birth.

```sql
SELECT T1.ID AS "Employee ID",
	T1.FIRST_NAME AS "First Name",
	T1.MIDDLE_NAME AS "Middle Name",
	T1.LAST_NAME AS "Last Name",
	T1.USER_ID AS "User ID",
	T2.DATE_OF_BIRTH AS "Date of Birth",
	CASE
		WHEN (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '18 years')::date < TO_DATE(T2.DATE_OF_BIRTH, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
		THEN true
		ELSE false
	END AS "Under 18"
FROM PUBLIC.EMPLOYEE T1
FULL OUTER JOIN PUBLIC.USER T2 ON T1.USER_ID = T2.ID;
```

## Updating a JSON Object column

To update a JSON object column in Postgres, you can use the `UPDATE` statement along with the `SET` clause and the `jsonb_set()` function.

**Syntax:** jsonb_set function

```sql
jsonb_set(COLUMN_NAME, '{key}', '"Value"', BOOLEAN_CREATE_IF_MISSING)
```

Here's an example of how you can update a JSON object column named data in a table named my_table:

```sql
UPDATE PUBLIC.USER
SET ADDRESS = jsonb_set(ADDRESS, '{city}', '"New York"', false)
WHERE id = 1;
```

This query updates the value of `user.address.city` to `New York` for user with id 1.

In jsonb_set function, the `BOOLEAN_CREATE_IF_MISSING` parameter is set to FALSE, so the `user.address.city` will be updated only when it already exists. The value defaults to `true` if it is not mentioned.

```sql
UPDATE PUBLIC.USER
SET ADDRESS = jsonb_set(ADDRESS, '{city}', '"New York"', true)
WHERE id = 1;
```

In this query the `user.address.city` will be created if it does not exist already, and it would be updated if it exists already.

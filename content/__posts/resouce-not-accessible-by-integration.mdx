Have you ever ran into this error when you want to trigger a CICD script on Github.

```sh
Resource not accessible by integration
```

If your answer is Yes, then you can try updating action settings for your github repository. It could be a scope issue quite possibly.

Just go to your github repository and then navigate to

```sh
Settings --> Actions --> General
```

Provide your actions read and write permissions.

## Using npm

```bash
npm outdated
```

This can be used to checked what dependencies in your packages are needed.

```bash
npm update
```

This can be used to update all the minor & patch updates in your dependencies, it'll also update your `package.lock.json` so that everything is in sync.

```bash
npm i next@latest
```

The `npm update` does not upgrade any of the dependencies to their major update versions, but if you want to take that risk. You can use this command.

## Using ncu: npm-check-updates

```bash
ncu
```

Shows you all the new version available.

```bash
ncu u
```

Updates your `package.json`

```bash
npm i
```

Installs all the updated dependencies to your project.

`ncu` provides some really cool ways to manage your dependencies which I really love. If you want to get into more details check out the link below:

Hope it helps. Thank you.

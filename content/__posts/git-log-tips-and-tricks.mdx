## Remove Merge Commits

To view commit history without merge commit we can use the option `--no-merges`.

```bash
git log --no-merges
```

## Formatting

The commit logs can be formatted using the option `--format`.

Here are some of the examples how you can format your commit history logs.

```bash
git log --pretty=oneline
```

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s %an, %cr"
```

This one if my favorite of all the ways to format my git logs. You'll know why when you try this out.

```bash
git log --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset - %s [%C(yellow)%an%Creset] %Cgreen(%cr)%Creset'
```

## Comparing Branches or Tags

Often one can find oneself in dire need of getting comparision git logs between two branches, or a branch and tag or simply two different tags.

Here's some of the example to achieve that goal.

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s %an, %cr" production..main --
```

Will compare the branches `production` & `master`.

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s %an, %cr" $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --
```

To compare your current `local branch's head` against the `latest tag`.

You might want to pull all the remote tags to your local before running the above command using:

```bash
git fetch --tags
```

## Filter By Author

It can be achieved simply by using the `--author` option.

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s %an, %cr" --author=thealchemist
```

**NOTE:** `thealchemist` in above command is the github username of the author, and the command works even when you provide it partial string like `thealche`.

### Bonus

You can use `git shortlog` instead of `git log` to group all the commits by authors, usint the `--group` option. The option does not work with `git log`.

```bash
git shortlog --pretty=format:"%h - %s %an, %cr" --group=author
```

Learn more about [Git Shortlog](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-shortlog).

## Limiting

The most easiest way to limit logs is to use the `-<n>` option, which is a placeholder or a template for `-5`.

```bash
git log -5
```

Will only show you only five recent commits.

Other than that you can also limit the logs using dates or a `grep string` using the option `--grep`.

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s %an, %cr" --since="2022-12-31" --before="2023-01-31"
```

Will show you logs for the month of January 2023.

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s %an, %cr" --since=4.weeks
```

Can be used to get logs for last four weeks.

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s %an, %cr" --grep="bump"
```

It will show only those commits which have the string `bump` in them.

## Bonus

If you've ever noticed, by default git pipes all output through a pager so one can only see one page of log output at a time.

If you want to view all the logs at once and skip the pagination you can use:

```bash
git --no-pager log --pretty=format:"%h - %s %an, %cr
```

**NOTE:** The `--no-pager` goes before the `log` in your command.

And, if you want to navigate between the pages when viewing the logs you can use `Space` key for the next page & `b` to go back one page.

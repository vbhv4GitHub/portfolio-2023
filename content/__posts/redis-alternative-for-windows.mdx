## Memurai

Using redis on windows or even setting up WSL2 on windows to use Redis can be painful experience at times. If you want to save some time and quickly move on dealing with your real problem at hand then `Memurai` is a best alternative out there.

The only downside of using Memurai if you want to use it for free is that you need to restart it every 10 days. That's all.

### Start Memurai

```bash
memurai.exe --service-start
```

### Stop Memurai

```bash
memurai.exe --service-stop
```

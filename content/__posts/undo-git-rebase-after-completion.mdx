Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you rebase your branch locally and then push your code to github, the file changes on the pull request gets all messed up?

Well, I've been there quite a few times. To avoid the situation I mostly prefer to use `git merge` instead of `git rebase`.

But if you are stuck in such a situation and don't want to close your PR only to reopen it with a new branch & brand new pull request this post might help.

## Git reflog

```bash
git reflog
```

It'll list down all your git logs with the information about when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository. That's what the `reflog` stands for `Reference Logs`. Once you find the `commit-sha` of your commit from where you started the rebase, use the command below.

```bash
git checkout commit-sha
```

It'll put the repository or your branch in a detached head state.

```bash
git switch -c new-branch-name
```

With the above command you can create a new branch which will be same as the state you were in before the rebase.

If you don't want a new branch then you can simply revert your current branch to state before rebase using the commands below.

```bash
git reset hard commit-sha
```

or

```bash
git reset hard HEAD@{2}
```

**BONUS:** `git switch -` acts like an undo command for your checkout steps.

Hope it was helpful. Thank you.

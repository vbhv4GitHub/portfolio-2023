The first place you should visit after visiting [MUI themeing documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/) for customizing your own MUI theme should be [MUI Theme Creator](https://zenoo.github.io/mui-theme-creator/).

Once you've played around a little bit with MUI theme creator here are some of the tips that might be helpful for you.

## Use default theme object in your custom theme

```typescript
import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';

const defaultTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#93c5fd',
      light: '#bfdbfe',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#fef3c7',
    },
  },
});

const theme = createTheme(defaultTheme, {
  palette: {
    divider: defaultTheme.palette.primary.light,
  },
  components: {
    MuiChip: {
      styleOverrides: {
        label: {
          color: defaultTheme.palette.primary.main,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

As you can see instead of using the hex code for colors everywhere in my custom theme I'm using the `defaultTheme` itself. Hope you get the point.

## Declare modules to avoid typescript lint problem

Let's say you want to add a custom property to your primary theme palette called `master`. By default you'll not be able to do so due to type checking restrictions.

The typescript lint error would appear something like this.

```bash
Type '{ main: string; master: string; }' is not assignable to type 'PaletteColorOptions | undefined'.
  Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'master' does not exist in type 'PaletteColorOptions'.ts(2322)
```

To get around this problem you just need to declare a custom module by yourself just like the example shared below, and voila!!!

```typescript
import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';

declare module '@mui/material/styles' {
  interface PaletteColorOptions {
    main: string;
    master: string;
  }
}

const defaultTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: 'dark',
    primary: {
      main: '#93c5fd',
      master: '#fff',
    },
  },
});
```

For the time being those are the only tips I've. Hopefully I'll make improvements on this post in the future.

Thank you. Happy Coding.
